2. Enter a name for your wallet
3. Input your Solana wallet address
4. Click "Connect" to fetch your wallet's transaction history
5. Add additional wallets if needed with the "Add Another Wallet" button

### Process Transactions

- When a wallet is connected, its transactions will be analyzed automatically
- If multiple wallets are connected, they will be processed in sequence
- You can view the queue status in the dashboard

## Token Registry Service

The application now includes a powerful Token Registry Service that enhances transaction processing by providing accurate token metadata. The service:

1. **On-Chain Metadata**: Fetches token metadata directly from the Solana blockchain using the Token Metadata Program, providing accurate information for any token encountered.

2. **Intelligent Caching**: Implements a sophisticated caching system to minimize RPC calls and improve performance.

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Uses a multi-layered approach to token identification:
   - First tries the local cache
   - Then checks known tokens list
   - Finally fetches metadata from on-chain sources
   - Creates sensible defaults for unknown tokens

4. **Rate Limiting Protection**: Includes queue processing with batch handling to prevent RPC rate limits.

5. **Enhanced Transaction Processing**: Automatically identifies tokens involved in transactions, improving the accuracy of transaction type detection.

### Usage

The token registry service is used throughout the application to:

- Identify tokens involved in DEX transactions (swaps, buys, sells)
- Provide accurate token symbols and names in the transaction table
- Enhance transaction categorization for better tax calculations

### Implementation Details

The token registry uses Metaplex's Token Metadata Program to fetch on-chain metadata for SPL tokens. It employs a singleton pattern to maintain a consistent cache across the application.

```javascript
// Example: Getting token metadata
import tokenRegistryService from './services/tokenRegistryService';

// Fetch metadata for a token
const tokenInfo = await tokenRegistryService.getTokenMetadata('EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v');
console.log(tokenInfo.symbol); // 'USDC'

// Extract tokens from a transaction
const tokens = await tokenRegistryService.extractTokensFromTransaction(transaction, accountKeys);
```
